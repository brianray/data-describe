**I want to add a new feature or change an existing one**

### If it's a small change / isolated to an existing feature:

Open a new *Feature Request* issue on Github.

### If it's a core/system change or a new functionality:

1. Start a new discussion on Slack. 
2. When you have gathered positive feedback, use the [design template](docs/designs/TEMPLATE.md) to submit a design proposal in a pull request.
3. Upon approval, create a new feature request issue.
