data_describe.backends
=============================

.. py:module:: data_describe.backends

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   `backends` implements a pluggable architecture for the data-describe package.

   This allows third-party libraries to provide alternative implementation details
   for data-describe: for example, implementing Bokeh plot (visualizations, abbreviated
   as `viz`) or implementing calculations on compute clusters (`compute`).

   Default implementations in data-describe are also exposed as plugins to this backend system.

   .. note:: This subpackage is typically not used by end users of data-describe.
