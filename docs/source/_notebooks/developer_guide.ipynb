    "## Contributing to data-describe\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for taking the time to contribute to data-describe! Although this guide does not explicitly assume knowledge of things like git and Python, you may find it helpful to do some additional study on those topics to supplement your learning. If you're already experienced, feel free to skip to the sections which discuss more details about best practices when contributing code to data-describe.\n",

    "### Code of Conduct\n",
    "All contributors are expected to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/data-describe/data-describe/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started - Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"to do\" task list for data-describe starts at the [Issues](https://github.com/data-describe/data-describe/issues) page in Github. Issues generally fall under one of two categories:\n",
    "- *Bugs*: Parts of data-describe that aren't working as they should\n",
    "- *Enhancements*: Requests for additions or changes to data-describe to make it better\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Before submitting a new issue, you should search the existing issues to make sure that it hasn't already been reported. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Filing a bug report\n",
    "Bug reports are important in helping identify things that aren't working in data-describe. Filing a bug report is straightforward: Head to the [Issues](https://github.com/data-describe/data-describe/issues) page, click on the [New issue](https://github.com/data-describe/data-describe/issues/new/choose) button, and select the [Bug Report](https://github.com/data-describe/data-describe/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug_report.md) template to get started.\n",

    "\n",
    "Next, you'll want to fill out the contents of the Bug Report. The contents have been pre-filled with a template with guidance on common details that should be included in a bug report. While this isn't a complete guide to Markdown, here are a few quick tips on how to read and fill out the template:\n",
    "\n",
    "`** Header Sections **` : Some example sections are provided to help guide the contents of your report\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Filing a Feature Request (Enhancement)\n",
    "Filing a feature request follows the similar steps. However, since enhancements can be more subjective in nature than bug reports, it is recommended to follow the guidelines below when filing a feature request:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Incremental changes: Small, incremental changes (for example, clarifying the labels on a plot, or extending configuration support for a feature) can be started by using the [Feature Request template](https://github.com/data-describe/data-describe/issues/new?labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md) when creating a new issue. Even for small changes, it's recommended to describe your thought process - how and/or why the enhancement would be beneficial.\n",
    "2. Brand new features / Large Reworks / System Redesign: For brand new features or other enhancements that may involve large changes, a design document should be written to explain and document the scope of the changes. A template for this design document can be found in the repository at `docs/designs/TEMPLATE.md`. This document can be submitted in a Pull Request, which is described further below."

    "For brand new contributors, jumping head first into squashing bugs or designing new features can be overwhelming. Finding an issue to start on can be easier by [searching under the *good first issue* label](https://github.com/data-describe/data-describe/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). Issues that are tagged as *good first issue* typically involve small changes such as fixing errors in documentation. \n",

If they are unable or unwilling to complete work on the issue, or you don't receive any response in a reasonable time frame (~ 2 weeks), the issue may be re-assigned as needed.\n",

    "## data-describe Design\n",
    "The following section describes design patterns used in the Python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Dependencies\n",
    "data-describe may make use of optional dependencies such as `nltk` or `modin`. When adding or using these optional dependencies in data-describe modules, the following patterns should be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `_requires` marks functionality that requires a dependency\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `_requires` decorator on any object function or class that needs the optional dependency. Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from data_describe.compat import _requires\n",
    "\n",
    "@_requires(\"nltk\")\n",
    "def function_that_uses_nltk():\n",
    "    return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`_requires` should generally take the top-level package name as its sole argument. See the section on *packages vs subpackages* for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `_compat` is used to lazily import from dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having import statements at the top of the file, import and use the `_compat` object to use functionalities from the optional dependency:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from data_describe.compat import _requires, _compat\n",
    "\n",
    "@_requires(\"nltk\")\n",
    "def function_that_uses_nltk_freqdist():\n",
    "    _compat[\"nltk\"].FreqDist()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`_compat` should generally take the sub-package as its key in a dictionary-style access. See the section on *packages vs subpackages* for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### packages vs subpackages\n",
    "\n",
    "Some packages do not export all of their subpackages. For example, `import statsmodels` does not provide access to `statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots`, as the `graphics` subpackage is not exported.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, `_requires` generally takes the top-level package name, as this checks if the package itself is installed. In contrast, `_compat` takes the subpackage to enable imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "One exception to this are the google client libraries such as `google-cloud-storage` or `google-cloud-bigquery`. Each of these are installed individually, but they are organized as subpackages of the `google` namespace i.e. `google.cloud.storage`. In this case, `_requires` should instead be the specific subpackage (i.e. `_requires(\"google.cloud.storage\")`) since requiring only the `google` package is not specific enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Side imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Some packages require downloads of additional data or models to function. One example is the stopwords for `nltk`. Downloading of these resources is handled in `data_describe/compat/_dependency.py`. When adding a dependency that requires this download, adhere to the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add a function that takes the module as its sole argument, checks for the existence of the resource (i.e if it was already downloaded), and executes the download if it doesn't exist. \n",
    "2. Add this function to the module-import mapping used to initialize `_compat`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "_compat = DependencyManager(\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"nltk\": nltk_download,\n",
    "        \"spacy\": spacy_download,\n",
    "        # \"new_package\": downloader_function,\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add to `extras_require` in setup.py\n",
    "\n",
    "The new dependency should be added to the `extras_require` in setup.py. If applicable, try to use existing tags over creating new ones. New tags should be alphabetical and short.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add to conda environments\n",
    "\n",
    "The new dependency should be added to all conda environment definitions. These are located in two locations: `etc/*.yml` and `docker/*/*.yml`"
