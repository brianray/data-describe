data_describe.compat
===========================

.. py:module:: data_describe.compat

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   data-describe compatibility and checks.

   data-describe makes use of a wide range of Python dependencies that
   are not applicable (and thus not required) for all users. The logic for
   handling these optional dependencies (e.g. lazy-loading) is implemented here.

   .. note:: This subpackage is typically not used by end users of data-describe.
